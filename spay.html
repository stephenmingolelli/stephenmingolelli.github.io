								<h1>Spay and Neuter</h1>
								<p>Kitties are cute, but...</p>
							</header>
							<div class="image main"><img src="images/KittyPoster.png" alt="" /></div>
							<p>We all love kitties, but too many can cause trouble. Many parts of the US experience cat overpopulation, which burdens shelters and cities. The poster above shows an estimate (400) of how many kitties will be born in seven years from a single couple and their offspring in 7 years, only assuming that half even have kittens at all (sourced from the Lynchburg Humane Society). Still think 400 doesn't sound like a lot? Let's put some numbers on that. 400 kitties means that over those seven years: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Over 500,000 cups of food will have been eaten.</li>
								<li>Over 940,000 pounds of litter will have been emptied.</li>
								<li>Over 63,000 gallons of water will have been drunk.</li>
								<li>They would need, at minimum, 8,000 square feet. That's almost four houses, using the median size.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>How do you come to these numbers?</h2>
							<p>Kitties are great, but we don't have the resources to keep four houses of them. We know that spaying and neutering can seem a little daunting or even present a financial barrier to some (those who own large dogs). However, there are some organizations and places that will bear the burden of the cost, since it's far cheaper in the long-term to spay and neuter pets. If your cat is not yet spayed or neutered, we strongly urge you to reach out to your local vet to discuss the best time for the procedure. Consider supporting local TNR programs or spreading the word about the importance of these surgeries. Together, we can make a significant difference in the lives of our feline friends and our communities.</p>
							It’s important to note that 400 is at the somewhat higher end of estimates. However, it isn’t necessarily all that unlikely. You’ve probably heard of estimates that range in the thousands. Those numbers are not necessarily false. They are unlikely.
							<p>Let me explain. Many of those numbers come from a few assumptions, misunderstandings, and warped statistics. But first, the assumptions. Many of these numbers assume that a mother cat and her kittens (all female) will have 12 kittens per litter. 12 is a theoretical high, but it is not the average. They also assume that every single one of these twelve kittens will survive birth and kittenhood. Finally, it also assumes every single one of these twelve kittens will have a chance to mate. Unfortunately, many wild cats die before they can find a partner.</p>
							<p>So, yes, hundreds of thousands of cats may be born in seven years by one couple. However, only if you assume that the family and the offspring have the largest possible litter on average, all survive childbirth and kittenhood, and all are able to survive well into adulthood to reproduce multiple times. It’s theoretically possible the same way it’s theoretically possible that you can flip a coin every day for the next year and only have it come up with landing heads.</p>
							<p>Someone was the first to publish these numbers, and it disseminated into the mainstream. As a result, people have misinterpreted it such that they assume one stray cat will cause a cat apocalypse in their neighborhood, and that soon 400,000 kittens will descend upon their house.</p>
							<p>As adorable as that sounds, it is incredibly unlikely. As such, the number was repeated several times without too much fact-checking.</p>
							<p>Other estimates tend to favor anywhere between 100 and 400. One could argue that even 400 is still on the more liberal side. However, this is also not to downplay the significance of that number. While 400 seems very small compared to 400,000, it’s essential to remember that many of these cats will mate with other cats. 400 is only for one family line in seven years, not an entire community. The number quickly explodes.</p>
							<h2>Benefits of Spaying and Neutering</h2>
							<p>But let’s talk about the benefits. Aside from population control, what are the benefits of spaying and neutering regarding cat health?</p>
							<p>Aside from being able to reduce homeless cats, it does have an environmental impact and is part of responsible pet ownership. While we like to joke that our little fluffy kitties are deadly killers when they attack that mangled toy, this is actually closer to reality than you might think.
							<p>Feral cats and outdoor cats, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, are “a significant cause for decline in many species native to North America.” (Free-ranging and Feral Cats). This is largely due to the fact that cats are obligate carnivores. This point often gets disputed by cat owners on social media, which is often a nexus of misinformation or disinformation. While dry cat food doesn’t quite resemble the prey a cat would find in the wild, it does consist of animal protein. Feral cats don’t typically have access to dry food and resort to killing prey, which can decimate a native population when the feral cat population is very high.</p>
							<p>These community benefits are great. If you are already familiar with feral cats and the environment but are curious about the individual aspects, then you should know that spaying and neutering can also be important to cat health and the longevity of your feline friend.</p>
							<p>According to the ASPCA, these procedures decrease the likelihood of your female cat from facing terrible urinary infections or having complications with malignant growths. They can even reduce the risk of breast cancer in your pet. Similarly, it reduces the risk for prostate problems and testical issues in male cats.</p>
							<p>These are the main advantages of spaying your cat: to ensure its long-term health and avoid common reproductive health issues.</p>
							<h2>Myths and misconceptions</h2>
							<p>We should also address the misinformation or even disinformation that gets spread online. While social media and the internet has made it extremely easily to access good information, it has also made it very easy for people to take advantage of that and spread false information.</p>
							<p>There are many spaying myths and neutering myths regarding the cat surgery procedure. Some people believe that their cat will experience a radical mood shift after the procedure is done. While the procedure may be uncomfortable for a while, there is no evidence to suggest that their behavior will change in the long-term. According to the Spay Neuter Assistance Program.</p>
							<p>Others falsely believe that it will increase health risks or shorten their pet’s lifespan. However, we have already shown that this is not the case.</p>
							<p>If you are concerned about the costs, reach out to local or national groups, as many are willing to work to fight against cat overpopulation.</p>
							<p>Thank you so much for reading this article. We wish you and your cats the best!</p>
