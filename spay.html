								<p>We all love kitties, but too many can cause trouble. Many parts of the US experience cat overpopulation, which burdens shelters and cities. The poster above shows a fairly conservative estimate (400) of how many kitties will be born in seven years from a single couple and their offspring in 7 years, only assuming that half even have kittens at all (sourced from the Lynchburg Humane Society). Still think 400 doesn't sound like a lot? Let's put some numbers on that. 400 kitties means that over those seven years: </p>
								<ul>
								<li>Over 500,000 cups of food will have been eaten.</li>
								<li>Over 940,000 pounds of litter will have been emptied.</li>
								<li>Over 63,000 gallons of water will have been drunk.</li>
								<li>They would need, at minimum, 8,000 square feet. That's almost four houses.</li>	
								</ul>
								<p>Kitties are great, but we don't have the resources to keep four houses of them. We know that spaying and neutering can seem a little daunting or even present a financial barrier to some (those who own large dogs). However, there are some organizations and places that will bear the burden of the cost, since it's far cheaper in the long-term to spay and neuter pets. If your cat is not yet spayed or neutered, we strongly urge you to reach out to your local vet to discuss the best time for the procedure. Consider supporting local TNR programs or spreading the word about the importance of these surgeries. Together, we can make a significant difference in the lives of our feline friends and our communities.</p>
