								<h3>Work Summary:</h3>
								<p>Business In Travel is your dedicated content marketing agency tailored for the travel industry. At the heart of their mission is the seamless connection between brands, businesses, and the visionary content creators of the world. Their expertise lies in crafting compelling narratives that not only showcase their clients' unique destinations, products, and experiences.</p>
								<p>However, the travel industry is incredibly competitive.</p>
								<p>We decided on rewriting large portions of category and product descriptions to make them pop. Plus, we identified several key problems that made the website not stand out in search engine queries. We conducted an SEO audit and corrected many of these issues while driving the SEO home.</p>
								<p>We added meta-descriptions to a dozen pages and added H1 tags that were overlooked. We cut down on duplicate content as well. Then, we took a long look at the service descriptions and decided to rewrite some of them to use focus keywords.</p>
								<p>We also decided to create a motif and eye-catching theme that would make their packages instantly stand-out so you would say "Ah, that's Iron Roast!" The result was the repeating 'Fe' symbol.</p>
								<h3>Rebranding Summary:</h3>
								<p><strong>Goal</strong>: My objective was to steer the brand towards not merely being seen but being significant. This involved a meticulous analysis and re-engineering of website content, honing in on focus keywords that align with the brand's essence and audience's search behaviors. That meant using top of the line SEO strategies.</p>
								<p><strong>Target</strong>: The intent was clear â€“ guide the browsers through a journey, from initial curiosity to a decisive action, fostering a seamless transition through strategically layered content and calls-to-action that resonate and motivate.</p>
								<p><strong>Methodology</strong>: Rewrite portions of the website and use the best SEO practices to ensure high levels of engagement and search-engine rankings. Integrating SEO not as an afterthought but as a fundamental aspect of content creation, ensuring every sentence contributed to the dual goals of engaging the audience and satisfying search engine algorithms. </p>
