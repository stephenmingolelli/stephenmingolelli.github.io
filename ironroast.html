				<h3>Unleash your inner metalhead</h3>
				<p>Iron Roast is a small coffee company located in central Florida. It pitches itself by delivering
				  unique coffee flavors not commonly seen. However, their original packaging was non-distinct and
				  poorly communicated who their intended audience was. Therefore, a complete overhaul of brand
				  packaging and voice was essential. Moreover, to boost online presence, webpages were revamped and
				  rewritten entirely with a focus on SEO optimization.</p>
				<h3>Work Summary</h3>
				<p>Ultimately, we settled on playing into the metal and punk themes by creating labels and designs with an edge to them. Iron Roast has always wanted to set itself up as a brand that fights the system,&nbsp;demonstrated by their pledge to donate 10% of all profits to the Innocence Project.</p>
				<p>We also decided to create a motif and eye-catching theme that would make their packages instantly stand-out so you would say "Ah, that's Iron Roast!" The result was the repeating 'Fe' symbol.</p>
				<h3>Rebranding Summary:</h3>
				<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Enhance brand recognition among coffee metal &amp; punk aficionados who prioritize premium
				quality in their coffee experience.&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Target</strong>: Attract a new audience by redefining Iron Roast as a distinctive brand that is making an impact.</p>
				<p><strong>D</strong><strong>efine</strong>: Position Iron Roast as a brand that stands out with its
					unique, character-rich flavor profiles, distinguishing itself in the coffee industry.</p>
				<p><strong>Methodology</strong>: Enhance the brand's identity through striking design, inventive naming,
				and a comprehensive rebranding initiative to infuse Iron Roast with a memorable personality. Establish a clear goal and way of drawing attention and doing good.</p>
