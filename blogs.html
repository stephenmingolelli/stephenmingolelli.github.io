        <h1>Haitian Coffee</h1>
      </header>
      <div class="image main"></div>
		<p>This project was done for the Haitian Community. The goal was to bring presence and awareness to the history of Haitian coffee and Haitian coffee businesses.</p>
		<h2>The Rich Coffee Heritage of Haiti</h2>
<p>Coffee has been intimately intertwined with Haitian history and culture for centuries. At one point, this small Caribbean nation stood as a colossus in the world of coffee, furnishing about half of the global demand. Though production has declined significantly since then, the story of Haitian coffee beans is a fascinating look at the country's turbulent past and potential for the future.</p>
<h3>Ancient Origins</h3>
<p> The history of Haitian coffee, according to Sweet Maria's Coffee Library, The coffee plant was first introduced to the island of Hispaniola (now Haiti and the Dominican Republic) in the 1700s by the French. According to historical accounts, in the 1720s, a French naval officer named Gabriel de Clieu obtained a coffee plant from the Jardin Royal des Plantes botanical garden in Paris, and his goal was to bring it to Martinique. This mission was important enough to De Clieu, who had reportedly rationed his drinking water on the voyage to the Caribbean in order to keep the seedling alive. So it goes that this is the start of the Haitian coffee beans -- a Frenchman bringing them to boost prosperity.[1]
  We've seen these kinds of stories from time to time, however. A daring journey with sacrifice, even if it's just water for a coffee plant. The selfless de Clieu boldly decides to sacrifice hydration for the prospective coffee business in the Caribbean</p>
<p>&nbsp;But how much of it is true? Is it just a legend?
Well, it's hard to say. The veracity of this is eclipsed by de Clieu's self-image. According to Coffee: A Dark History, de Clieu had not been performing admirably as a colonial governor, a role from which he was then removed. It is possible that de Clieu, wracked with financial difficulties, fabricated the story, sacrificing truth to rekindle his dim reputation, and what better way to do that than bring Haitian coffee beans to the world? Haiti’s climate did lend itself to producing something good, afterall. And if de Clieu could stick the claim that he had brought such value to France, it would make him look quite good indeed.[2]
In other words, it is not entirely out of the question that de Clieu spun this tale to polish his public image, hoping to get a second chance and get in the good graces of employers.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, the best Haitian coffee would be thrust into markets, on a large scale, it would appear that he had the right idea. Nevertheless, it would appear that he had actually brought coffee into Martinique. The true grade and value of his odyssey cannot truly be said.
Even if the saga de Clieu were true to its final word, it is questionable as to whether or not his plan would have worked at the time, given that there is evidence that the Dutch had beaten de Clieu (and the French) at bringing coffee to the Caribbean. Thus, it cannot even be said that de Clieu's journey brought a bold and robust fortune unique only to the French.
That is not to understate its importance, however.
<h3>Rise to Global Dominance</h3>
The success and demand of Haitian coffee beans, in turn, created a greater demand for slave labor to match the demand. In other words, as it grew in popularity, the plantation owners expanded their enterprise. In turn, this necessitated an ever-growing cadre of enslaved individuals whose significance to the colony's prosperity far and away eclipsed that of the very men who reaped the profits of their labour.</p>
<p>According to Coffee: A Dark History, this meant that one ship of slaves came a week to Saint-Domingue (now called Haiti). Mark Pendergrast in Uncommon Grounds estimates that, in 1788, the Haitian colony furnished nearly half the globe's draught of coffee.[3][4]
  Haitian coffee production soared over the next decades, albeit through the brutal labor of enslaved Africans on plantations. However, the treatment of slaves in the harsh coffee cultivation system was one of the major grievances that fueled the Haitian Revolution.
  Toussaint Louverture spearheaded what had initially started out as a mere insurrection burgeoned into a full-fledged revolution that launched a scathing challenge to the French. Haitian coffee beans created much prosperity for France, and so it’s of no surprise that Napoleon Bonaparte would like to see the revolution crushed.</p>
<p>However, Bonaparte failed to regain control, and Haiti emerged as the first Black-led republic in 1804, a remarkable achievement that marked one of the very few successful uprisings by enslaved people in history. However, the valiant struggle for independence came at an enormous price in terms of human lives and industrial enterprise, with war reducing many places of business to ash and rubble. While Haiti would regain economic strength with coffee as a major export, it never remained at the same heights it once had.[5]
<h3>Turmoil and Revival</h3>
  Haitian coffee export and production struggled back on track in the decades after gaining independence. There were brief moments of recovery. However, they were only moments, and Haitian coffee beans did not regain prominence over other exporters.</p>
<p>Political instability, natural disasters, and soil depletion continually hampered the nation's recovery, not to mention the prize crop itself.
  By the late 20th century, the dwindling yields led many farmers to cut down their coffee trees for use as charcoal to afford basic necessities. Droughts and soil erosion have made it difficult to grow coffee in Haiti. However, even if these environmental challenges weren't present, Haiti has been the subject of various embargoes and sanctions.[6][7] The revival of Haitian coffee bean production on a large scale has been rendered an arduous journey. However, we do not need to measure success by how Haiti ranks among others. Their achievements do not hinge on the volume of the industry, as they are finding ground in the high-grade coffee industry, as Haitian coffee culture, in spite of everything, remains strong.
  Coffee consumption trends shifted in the United States and other developed nations.</p>
<p>Consumers became increasingly interested in high-quality, sustainable, and ethically sourced coffee from distinct geographic origins. This was the "third-wave" coffee movement. Many coffee drinkers were no longer content with the "grab-and-go" culture, though many large franchises have targeted this third-wave market.[8]
  This new market emphasis on terroir and traceability created an opportunity for Haitian coffee beans to return as a premium product for specialty roasters and cafes. Despite the modest production scale, a concerted focus emerged among companies to spearhead initiatives to enhance the quality of Haiti's coffee and refine its supply chain's intricacies. In other words, eyes were on sustainable and organic Haitian coffee, and people were eager to try it.[9]
<h3>Success Stories</h3>
  One of the early successes of this was in Haitian Bleu coffee beans (often incorrectly called Haitian Blue Coffee). It found its place in the market and turned a profit among those belonging to the specialty coffee scene or third-wave coffee movement. Not only could they trace the roots of the Haitian Bleu back to, well, Haiti, but it also had quality and was well-received.</p>
<p>Additionally, those who kept a pulse on social movements knew they would be supporting Haitians and communities who needed the money far more than certain big-brand coffee houses. The success of Haitian Bleu, however, did not last, with production issues becoming apparent shortly after its launch.[10]
  There was also COOPCAB. This Haitian coffee bean cooperative was designed to offer aid and support in communities that needed it most. The cooperative was largely in the hands of farmers native to the area. In addition to this was the Federation des Associations Cafetieres Natives, another coffee cooperative (the one that put Haitian Bleu on the market, actually). (As aid to Haiti slows, a private coffee co-op scores loans and turns heads).
  According to Root Capital, a financial partner of COOPCAB, "In the early 2000s, COOPCAB succeeded in marketing small volumes of its coffee to buyers in Japan, France, Italy and Canada." This was even fair trade Haitian coffee.[11]
  However, the political and economic policies of external powers have created challenges. The United States government employs agricultural subsidies, donations and low-cost exports for economic competition and aid. However, these cheap products and food aid often make it hard for locals to compete.[12]
  Given the success of COOPCAB and Haitian Bleu coffee beans, many hope to achieve the same caliber of success.</p>
<p>It's not entirely out of reach, either. And such stories inspire hope that the future can be bright. With globalization exposing consumers to coffee rarity and diversity, Haiti is well-positioned to continue rebuilding its once world-renowned coffee industry.
  This global exposure does indeed draw the gaze of the right-minded, well-meaning, and, yes, coffee aficionados who wish to support a good cause and effort. 
  This resurgence is not merely about strolling in the boneyard of history and reading the epitaphs of former glory but about charting a new trajectory that honors its heritage while embracing the opportunities of the present and future.</p>

        <h1>Beef Tea &amp; Toast Sandwiches</h1>
</header>
<p> The toast sandwich has become somewhat of a poster child for unappetizing recipes. It has even become a signpost for people to use when judging English cuisine, poking fun at something so simple that it could almost be a joke. What kind of sandwich should I have? Easy, just add another piece of bread</p>
	      <p>The toast sandwich debuted in the Invalid Cookery, a section from Household Management, a book from 1861. The section provides recipes for the sick. It starts with its daring glory -- “Thin cold toast, thin slices of bread-and-butter, pepper and salt to taste.”
	        It does seem that, at the very least, it’s not as bland as the name would suggest. You do get some butter and spices to go along with it. Still, I would forgive you for saying that you’re not too interested in trying it.
			  <p>Although, interestingly enough, the writer notes that you could always improve upon the toast sandwich with some meat, which would sort of make it a more regular sandwich.
	        Oddly enough, this isn’t the only kind of unique toast recipe in the Invalid Cookery. There is a recipe on how to make “toast-and-water,” which sounds as bad as you would imagine.
	        There are even instructions to make plain old toast and buttered toast. This sounds a little absurd, but remember that this was the mid-1800s. That meant your fancy toaster wasn’t around yet, much less accessible for many households. Among carrot jams and pigeon pies, there is also the more widely-known “1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hour to boil the macaroni” statement found in the book.</p>
	        <p>At a glance, it does seem strange that some of these basic recipes, which are really more like instructions, exist at all. Most people would have known how to make toast.
	        To explain the source of these somewhat seemingly patronising recipes instructions, we ought to hear it from Mrs. Isabella Beeton herself:
	        I have always thought that there is no more fruitful source of family discontent than a housewife's badly-cooked dinners and untidy ways. Men are now so well served out of doors,—at their clubs, well-ordered taverns, and dining-houses, that in order to compete with the attractions of these places, a mistress must be thoroughly acquainted with the theory and practice of cookery.</p>
	       <p>Beeton provides a rather lengthy list of individuals to whom she believes this book would appeal. Housekeepers, cooks, maids, nurses, valets and so much more. So, she was certainly trying to establish herself as an encompassing, authoritative figure on the household management.
	        At the same time, it certainly seems bizarre that someone who would want to make a name for themself as such would make some rather peculiar errors, such as grossly overestimating how much time it would take to boil macaroni. Are we left with the dreaded irony that someone who mourns the loss of the good old days doesn’t know how to boil pasta? Or perhaps with a book as vast as this, she was bound to make some rather unfortunate editorial errors.</p>
	        <p>It is, unfortunately, likely a mix of both. Macaroni is mentioned quite a lot in this book. In one recipe for minced veal and macaroni, her total time estimate is half an hour. Her estimate for simmering a macaroni soup is in the 30 minute range. It’s likely that some of her more quirky additions are just errors that got overlooked. However, some of them would appear to be on the more controversial side, as an article from the Guardian discusses Beeton’s plagiarism. So, maybe some anomalies are a poor copy-paste job.
	        Plus, as the Guardian notes, it’s not like Beeton had not contributed in some truly meaningful way. Her more streamlined format of writing did indeed make cooking more accessible to her intended audience of cooks, nurses and maids. And, while something like toast sandwiches seems far too frugal, many of the options in the book are on the more economic side without having to resort to something so drastic.</p>
	        <p>It is easy to judge Beeton. Stuff  like beef tea, water toast, and toast sandwiches seem to be too strange to ignore (for amusement more than anything else). But are we being too judgmental? Afterall, times have changed. Beef tea, which the book appears to claim is good for working with inflammatory diseases, and water toast were probably not too uncommon for the time. Barley water and rose water were also common drinks of the time, and they are likely derived from that line of thinking.
	        There are also some economic implications. Remember that some of the material here was written with caring for the sick in mind. Medicine and healthcare are expensive. A toast sandwich, however unappetizing that may seem, is at least economic, allowing a family some financial flexibility. It’s easy to make fun of it, however as a cheap and quick option for a nurse taking care of a sick person, it makes sense within the context in which it was written.</p>
	        This provides at least a modest defence for the seemingly dreaded toast sandwich, but this isn’t without some modern precedent. The Royal Society of Chemistry even went to bat for the darn thing. We could reinvent it as a spartan approach to the minimalist culinary world. But I fear that would be giving it far too much credit. In reality, it was likely a practical and accessible recipe that anyone could make with at least some purpose in caring for the poor and has now transformed into a meme of the food world.
          In summary, while the toast sandwich and similar recipes from Mrs. Beeton's book certainly gives us a few amusing anecdotes in the Victorian culinary world, it is important to consider the context. Who knows what current food trends we have today that will no doubt become the subject of similar mockery. (Probably avocado toast). </p>

        <h1>Ways to Upgrade your Coffee</h1>
			<p>Coffee made at home can feel unrewarding compared to some of the lovely coffee shops we go to all the time. Sometimes, it just seems like they do something different, something unique to bring out the flavor of the coffee.
Well, we have good news for you. This art is not reserved for professional baristas or gourmet coffee shops. Anyone can do it, so long as they have the ingredients and a will to try something new.
Whether you’re a true at home-barista or just someone looking to make that typical tin of coffee taste better, we’re offering a few simple ways to boost your coffee game at home.</p>

<h3>Salt</h3>
<p>One common issue we hear with a lot of store-bought coffee is that it can taste bitter or even have a somewhat “burnt” taste to it. Coffee already packs a somewhat acidic punch, but there is a way to temper that.
Simply, add just a pinch of salt. There are multiple variations on this, from adding it to the milk and frothing, adding sea salt chunks as a topping, adding it to the drink itself, and more. The salt helps to take out some of the bitterness, and it can be an excellent choice if you don’t prefer adding milk or sugar to your drink.</p>
<p>If you're skeptical about adding salt before brewing, experiment by adding it to your prepared cup. This way, you can take a sip-and-adjust approach to your freshly brewed cup of joe.</p>
<p>If you’re someone who has gotten used to that acerbic attitude of coffee, well, then you could skip this. Maybe you’ll like the others just a pinch more.</p>
			<h3>Spices</h3>
<p>Adding a little bit, very little bit, of nutmeg or cinnamon to your coffee grounds can help add a flavorful profile to your coffee when you brew it.
If you’re like me, you might add a dusting of these spices to the top of your coffee and let it swim to the top for a little bit.</p>
<p>If you like something spicy, you can add chili powder to your coffee. Toss in a little chocolate, and you’ve got something that can mellow out the spice a pinch. But remember, the key is in the balance. You want to add just enough chili to spark a slight warmth without overwhelming the coffee's inherent flavors.</p>
			<h3>Butter</h3>
<p>Butter coffee has become a fad among some fitness enthusiasts or those favoring a low-carb and high-fat diet. Mixing butter to coffee has been done long before the trend kicked off. In fact, it is a popular addition in places like Ethiopia and Tibet.</p>
<p>It's entirely feasible to start with a small amount of butter if it sounds too heavy for your morning routine, gauging personal preference and adjusting the quantity to find the perfect balance that enhances the coffee without overwhelming it.</p>
			<h3>Tea</h3>
<p>I know, I know. Tea vs coffee is like cats vs dogs for some people, but it’s an incredibly delicious way to get the best of both worlds. You can have the luxury of not choosing one or the other. Don’t let anyone stop you. This blend is quite popular in various Asian countries where both beverage traditions have a very long history.</p>
<p>Imagine savoring a fusion that marries the rich, robust aroma of coffee with the delicate, nuanced flavors of tea. Now that’s tasty.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something light and delicate, I would use a splash of green tea. It can add a refreshing, slightly grassy note to the coffee.</p>
<p>For those with an adventurous side, mixing coffee with herbal teas like chamomile or peppermint can introduce an entirely new spectrum of flavors, with the latter being good for something more chocolatey, of course.</p>
<h3>Extracts</h3>
<p>One of my favorite methods is adding just a drop of extract into my coffee. A pinch of extract, especially for something like vanilla, adds a subtle depth that can round out the coffee's acidity and bitterness, offering a smooth taste. By softening the harsher notes while accentuating the pleasant ones, you can get a nice, typical but much appreciated flavor.</p>
<p>Something like butter extract can add a little more of a decadent touch, but that’s far from a bad thing. It can give you the richness and texture of butter’s flavor without having to dump in a whole spoonful.</p>
<p>My personal favorite choice is anise extract, which offers a bold, sweet, and licorice-y touch. It’s a bit more of a personal preference compared to something like vanilla. Don’t knock it before you try it, though!</p>
<p>A little bit can go a long way when it comes to this kind of addition, giving you just that much more delight to your morning coffee routine.</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The power lies in the details. Simple additions, like a pinch of salt, a dash of spice, or even a drop of extract, can transform your everyday brew into something unique and your own.</p>
<p>So, grab your favorite mug, and personalize your coffee into something that truly satisfies—sip by sip.</p>
